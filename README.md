# Thesis Template

This repository includes a template for your thesis.

## Getting started

1. Click on the "Use this template" button in GitHub and make a new private repository for your thesis.
2. Clone your new repository with `git`.
3. Run `make` to check that everything works. The resulting thesis file should be in `thesis.pdf`
4. Fill in the blanks in `metadata.tex`.
5. Read through the example code, then erase it.
6. Write your thesis.
7. Remove the `todos.tex` file.
8. Submit and defend the thesis!

### Installing LaTeX

Be sure to install a LaTeX toolchain with `lualatex` support.

- On a unix-style system, use TeXLive, your package manager has something like `texlive-full` or `texlive-scheme-full`.
- On Windows, use [MiKTeX](https://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html).

#### Editor support

If you want to have a Overleaf-like experience locally, we recommend using VSCode with the `james-yu.latex-workshop` package.

## Disclaimer

While this is a good starting point, we offer no guarantee that this structure is appropiate for your particular thesis or covers all requirements for a good grade.
It is _your_ responsibility to appropiately adjust this template to fit your needs and requirements.
